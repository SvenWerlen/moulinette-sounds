**IMPORTANT** : This module has been reimplemented under :

* [Media Search](https://github.com/Moulinette-Craft/moulinette-foundryvtt-module) : searching for sounds & music, indexing your own files.
* [Soundboard & Soundpad](https://github.com/Moulinette-Craft/moulinette-audio-foundryvtt-module) : soundboards & soundpads.

Development (FoundryVTT v12+) will continue exclusively on the new modules.
